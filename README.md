 # Calculator The Game

## About the project
This project is a personal initiative for study and learning, inspired by the original game "Calculator The Game", created by <a href="https://www.kurtiswow.com/">kurtiswow<a/>. This version aims to recreate and understand the concepts behind this creative game.

The game transforms simple mathematical operations into challenging puzzles, stimulating logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.

The main goal of this project is to strengthen my knowledge in web development using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as to practice programming logic and game creation.
